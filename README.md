And make it social so people can make friends (School 


It will hold all the spiritual lore, 
The idea of mazed is to make a map, that people can use to find themselves, god, and there version of it


## Window sizes

You can define the initial window size when launching the Electron app by setting the `APP_SIZE` environment variable. The value must be one of the supported resolutions:

- `1024x575`
- `1280x720`
- `1600x900`
- `1920x1080`

Example:

```bash
APP_SIZE=1280x720 npm start
```

If `APP_SIZE` is not provided or has an invalid value, the default size of `800x600` is used.


After launching the application you can change the size at any time using the
size selector located in the sidebar. Choose one of the supported resolutions
and press **Apply Size**. The selected dimensions are stored so that the app
opens with the same size on the next launch.
